# Graphene-GUI

# Machine Learning Algorithm
Trained K-nearest neighbors on the rawdata.csv to predict mechanical properties 'Fracture Strain','Fracture Strength' and 'Young's Modulus' of Graphene.
- Open Matlab
- Import rawdata.csv into workspace
- Run knn.m for ML model

# graphene_gui.m
Contains the code for the GUI which takes input parameters and outputs the reqired Mechanical properties of Graphene.
