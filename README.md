# Graphene-GUI

Done as a part of course ME3100 - Modelling and Simulation.  

### Machine Learning Algorithm
Trained K-nearest neighbors on the rawdata.csv to predict mechanical properties, 'Fracture Strain','Fracture Strength' and 'Young's Modulus' of Graphene.
- Open Matlab
- Import rawdata.csv into workspace
- Run knn.m for ML model

### graphene_gui.m
Contains the code for the GUI which takes input parameters and outputs the required Mechanical properties of Graphene.

#### - Go through the ME3100_Report for detailed explanation
